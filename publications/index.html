    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Nonadiabatic dynamics plays a crucial role in electronic excitation processes across chemical, physical, biological, and materials sciences. This thesis proposes a novel constrained phase space mapping approach for multi-electronic state systems, aiming to uniformly address nonadiabatic problems involving both continuous degrees of freedom of nuclei and discrete degrees of freedom of electronic states. The approach leads to a unified phase space mapping framework and its corresponding trajectory-based approximations. Different from the traditional Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss harmonic oscillator-based mapping approach, the thesis constructs the exact mapping from the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The paper emphasizes the one-to-one correspondence/mapping between quantum operators and phase functions within nonadiabatic systems, including three key elements: 1) trajectory initial conditions sampled from appropriate constraint phase space; 2) phase space integral for time correlation function, where phase functions are included; and 3) equations of motion on phase space and their trajectory approximations.</p>

<p>The thesis summarizes the concepts of mapping kernels and sampling manifolds in the constrained phase space of electronic states, and enumerates the diversity of definitions for sampling manifolds and phase functions. In particular, this study connects Cotton’s triangular window (TW) function to the constrained phase space through projection, proving that it is an exact phase function for two-state systems and satisfying the positive semi-definiteness for estimation of population. Furthermore, the study develops the weighted phase space (WPS), where the weighted mapping model (wMM) method provides a better description of the coherence/decoherence phenomena of electronic states. It is found that under cyclic focused sampling (CFS) condition, the weighted mapping model (wMM/CFS) connects the MM-Focused and GDTWA schemes, and corrects the population estimation in Ehrenfest dynamics through the limit of the weighted manifold, thereby examining the shortcomings of the Ehrenfest method. Within the theoretical framework of phase space representation, the thesis introduces the independent trajectory approximation picture, improves over the mean-field method by introducing commutator variables, and also proposes nonadiabatic field (NaF) trajectory approximations, which yield the consistent transition between Born-Oppenheimer single-state force characteristics and mean-field mixed force characteristics. These studies lay the foundation for applications in real systems.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the study applies phase space nonadiabatic dynamics methods with the independent trajectory approximation, such as NaF-TW, to various practical chemical/biological systems, such as photoisomerization of double bonds, molecular motor simulation, photochemical reactions of small molecules, and nonadiabatic processes of rhodopsin, effectively verifying the potential of phase space methods in studying practical nonadiabatic problems. After describing a set of code frameworks “KIDS” for effectively solving nonadiabatic dynamics problems in phase space, the thesis further concludes and discusses some perspectives.</p>

We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 145, 204105 (2016); 151, 024105 (2019); J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 12, 2496 (2021), non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 145, 144108 (2016), is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</p>

We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. The NaF-TW expression of the population of any adiabatic state is always positive semidefinite. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is able to faithfully capture the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs in a broad region, including where the states remain coupled all the time, as well as where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is important</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century after Ehrenfest proposed “Phasenraum” and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a conceptually novel trajectorybased nonadiabatic dynamics approach, nonadiabatic field (NAF), based on a generalized exact coordinate−momentum phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the conventional Born−Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic coupling region. Instead, in NAF the equations of motion of the independent trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NAF offers a practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Elucidating the mechanism of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is a prerequisite for designing more AIE-gens. The diphenylethylene (DPE) featured molecules are one of the most important AIE-gens due to their propeller structure. Three representative DPE-featured AIE-gens, triphenylethylene, cis-stilbene, and trans-stilbene, are explored via ultrafast ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Both experimental and computational results suggest that readily crossing conical intersections (CIs) with flexible structural evolutions in solutions significantly reduces fluorescence, whereas crossing CIs is restricted because of high energy cost, and therefore no fast nonradiative decay can compete with spontaneous emission in solids. The mechanism also well explains the different emission quantum yields and interconversion ratios between cis-stilbene and trans-stilbene after photoexcitation.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Transition path flight times are studied for scattering on two electronic surfaces with a single crossing. These flight times reveal nontrivial quantum effects such as resonance lifetimes and nonclassical passage times and reveal that nonadiabatic effects often increase flight times. The flight times are computed using numerically exact time propagation and compared with results obtained from the Fewest Switches Surface Hopping (FSSH) method. Comparison of the two methods shows that the FSSH method is reliable for transition path times only when the scattering is classically allowed on the relevant adiabatic surfaces. However, where quantum effects such as tunneling and resonances dominate, the FSSH method is not adequate to accurately predict the correct times and transition probabilities. These results highlight limitations in methods which do not account for quantum interference effects, and suggest that measuring flight times is important for obtaining insights from the time-domain into quantum effects in nonadiabatic scattering.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Nonadiabatic dynamical processes are one of the most important quantum mechanical phenomena in chemical, materials, biological, and environmental molecular systems, where the coupling between different electronic states is either inherent in the molecular structure or induced by the (intense) external field. The curse of dimensionality indicates the intractable exponential scaling of calculation effort with system size and restricts the implementation of “numerically exact” approaches for realistic large systems. The phase space formulation of quantum mechanics offers an important theoretical framework for constructing practical approximate trajectory-based methods for quantum dynamics. This Account reviews our recent progress in phase space mapping theory: a unified framework for constructing the mapping Hamiltonian on phase space for coupled F-state systems where the renowned Meyer–Miller Hamiltonian model is a special case, a general phase space formulation of quantum mechanics for nonadiabatic systems where the electronic degrees of freedom are mapped onto constraint space and the nuclear degrees of freedom are mapped onto infinite space, and an isomorphism between the mapping phase space approach for nonadiabatic systems and that for nonequilibrium electron transport processes. While the zero-point-energy parameter is conventionally assumed to be positive, we show that the constraint implied in the conventional Meyer–Miller mapping Hamiltonian requires that such a parameter can be negative as well and lies in (−1/F, +∞) for each electronic degree of freedom. More importantly, the zero-point-energy parameter should be interpreted as a special case of a commutator matrix in the comprehensive phase space mapping Hamiltonian for nonadiabatic systems. From the rigorous formulation of mapping phase space, we propose approximate but practical trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics methods. The applications to both gas phase and condensed phase problems include the spin-boson model for condensed phase dissipative two-state systems, the three-state photodissociation models, the seven-site model of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson monomer in photosynthesis of green sulfur bacteria, the strongly coupled molecular/atomic matter–optical cavity systems designed for controlling and manipulating chemical dynamical processes, and the Landauer model for a quantum dot state coupled with two electrodes. In these applications the overall performance of our phase space mapping dynamics approach is superior to two prevailing trajectory-based methods, Ehrenfest dynamics and fewest switches surface hopping.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>We show that a novel, general phase space mapping Hamiltonian for nonadiabatic systems, which is reminiscent of the renowned Meyer–Miller mapping Hamiltonian, involves a commutator variable matrix rather than the conventional zero-point-energy parameter. In the exact mapping formulation on constraint space for phase space approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics, the general mapping Hamiltonian with commutator variables can be employed to generate approximate trajectory-based dynamics. Various benchmark model tests, which range from gas phase to condensed phase systems, suggest that the overall performance of the general mapping Hamiltonian is better than that of the conventional Meyer–Miller Hamiltonian.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>The celebrated Meyer–Miller mapping model has been a useful approach for generating practical trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics methods. It is generally assumed that the zero-point-energy (ZPE) parameter is positive. The constraint implied in the conventional Meyer–Miller mapping Hamiltonian for an F-electronic-state system actually requires γ∈(−1/F, ∞) for the ZPE parameter for each electronic degree of freedom. Both negative and positive values are possible for such a parameter. We first establish a rigorous formulation to construct exact mapping models in the Cartesian phase space when the constraint is applied. When nuclear dynamics is approximated by the linearized semiclassical initial value representation, a negative ZPE parameter could lead to reasonably good performance in describing dynamic behaviors in typical spin-boson models for condensed-phase two-state systems, even at challenging zero temperature.</p>

<p><em><strong>Highlight</strong>: This paper pioneers a novel uniformly constrained
    sampling method for MMST mapping variables, marking the first
    application of such an approach in field of nonadiabatic dynamics.
    This innovation establishes a crucial foundation for the constraint
    phase space (CPS), significantly advancing the theoretical and
    practical framework of MMST mapping approach.</em></p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Based on the recently developed unified theoretical framework [J. Liu, J. Chem. Phys. 145(20), 204105 (2016)], we propose a new perspective for studying nonadiabatic dynamics with classical mapping models (CMMs) of the coupled multistate Hamiltonian onto the Cartesian phase space. CMMs treat the underlying electronic state degrees of freedom classically with a simple physical population constraint while employing the linearized semiclassical initial value representation to describe the nuclear degrees of freedom. We have tested various benchmark condensed phase models where numerically exact results are available, which range from finite temperature to more challenging zero temperature, from adiabatic to nonadiabatic domains, and from weak to strong system-bath coupling regions. CMMs demonstrate overall reasonably accurate dynamics behaviors in comparison to exact results even in the asymptotic long time limit for various spin-boson models and site-exciton models. Further investigation of the strategy used in CMMs may lead to practically useful approaches to study nonadiabatic processes in realistic molecular systems in the condensed phase.</p>
